The finishes are exhibited in intricate tile recesses and the mind bending imagination is revealed when long, glass walls of the family room disappear to make the room transform into a part of the outdoors.  The view beyond that opening stretches peacefully out over the pool, through the hills and out to the sparkle of Lake Austin.    The private backyard and the green expanse of the majestic view demand that the architecture take advantage of the magic there.  The creative use of glass figures prominently in the home's design.  Two story walls of windows in the living room are dramatic.  Curved glass windows that echo the round breakfast area are playfully beautiful and the two glass walls in the family room that can be rolled back is astonishing.     In the dramatic entry, huge iron and glass doors with a massive arched transom open to a two-story space flanked by Cantera columns and a stone stairway with scrolled iron railing that twists gracefully to the upper floor. Matching scrolled ironwork railings overlook the two story living where recesses outfitted with cove lighting allow for dramatic presentation of artwork. Stone flooring meanders into the dining, with a dropped ceiling detail that mirrors the shape of the room and provides framework for the chandelier light.    The heart of the kitchen is a commercial Thermador stove with double ovens and 6 gas burners.  This gorgeous workhorse is the center of a cook's dream space beautifully outfitted with herringbone stone backsplash, richly stained alder cabinets and thick granite counters.     A welcoming wet bar with beautiful cabinetry and a wine refrigerator is an excellent stop between these wonderful spaces or on the way to huge patios, covered verandas and the enviable view that is worthy of a deep breath and a sip while your blood pressure falls after a day at the office.    Scrollwork iron matching the inside stair rails borders the patio out to the lovely pool and level lawn that ends in a spectacular view.    Mirrors hang floating in front of large windows in the master bath providing excellent light and striking originality of design.  A jetted oval tub under large windows, a generous shower recess with intricate tiled designs, and the luxury of body sprayers complete this spa bath.  The walk-in closet is filled with furniture quality built-ins and great, well thought out storage.    Bedrooms upstairs have access to beautiful baths and balconies with higher, even better views of the gentle slopes of the Hill Country and Lake.

Travis Country West is a southwest Austin neighborhood located four miles west of MoPac (Loop 1) on the south side of Southwest Parkway.

Homes in Travis Country West were constructed between 2002 and 2007 with builders DR Horton and Morrison Homes.

Neighborhood Description

Barton Hills is THE place to live in 78704.  With the new development coming down Lamar that will add to what already is a vibrant Entertainment district, this has become one of the most desirable neighborhoods in town.  Old classics like The Broken Spoke and The Saxon Pub are being joined by new staples like Barley Swine and the family friendly Phil's Burgers and Amy's Ice Cream.  Barton Hills is blocks away from the Barton Creek Greenbelt as well as Zilker Park and Lady Bird Lake Hike and Bike Trails.  And if you ever decide to go leave all of this and head downtown, it's just a couple miles away.  It's the best of ALL worlds.

The development at 3103 Fontana sits on a narrow lot that backs onto lower East Bouldin Creek. The property is located in the heart of 78704 straddled by South Congress and South 1st streets and just a 9 iron from Dawson Elementary School.

The site now includes double driveways with access to covered parking for both units. At the back of the ground floors, huge living rooms with vaulted ceilings open onto private decks that look down on the creek.



Walking from your undercover parking to the front door and beyond, each unit at 3103 Fontana features an enormous ground-floor master bedroom, walk in closet and en-suite at the front of the house.

Multiple access points to the kitchen and livingroom provide a feeling of ample space with amenities, laundry and bathrooms accessible along the building’s shared wall.

The modern kitchen and island open into a shared dining and living space with vaulted ceilings, state of the art fixtures and a gateway to the outdoors. The deep, wide and similarly vaulted deck includes views of the creek and steps down to the manicured garden landscape.



Fontana’s stairwell opens into a custom entertainment room with console, TV and cable hookups. The space has natural light pouring through the windows and easy access to both additional bedrooms and the stairs.

Towards the street sits the second master with a full ensuite bathroom. The windows looks directly west making it the best room in the house for sunset-lovers.

At the other end of the top floor, the third bedroom overlooks the garden and East Bouldin Creek. Barn-style doors throughout add a rustic charm.

Noticing 3103 Fontana from the street, you will admire clean lines and a crisp color palette. Colors of the walls and trim are reversed on the covered parking areas which also feature electric car charging stations.

Manicured driveways and gated landscaping provide a serene stroll to the front door of either unit. High-end grasses and flora provide a low-maintenance visual appeal.



The back of the property falls away towards East Bouldin Creek. This elevation changes means when standing in the backyard, you’re looking up at the deck and living room of the units.

The development at 3103 Fontana sits on a narrow lot that backs onto lower East Bouldin Creek. The property is located in the heart of 78704 straddled by South Congress and South 1st streets and just a 9 iron from Dawson Elementary School.

The site now includes double driveways with access to covered parking for both units. At the back of the ground floors, huge living rooms with vaulted ceilings open onto private decks that look down on the creek.



Walking from your undercover parking to the front door and beyond, each unit at 3103 Fontana features an enormous ground-floor master bedroom, walk in closet and en-suite at the front of the house.

Multiple access points to the kitchen and livingroom provide a feeling of ample space with amenities, laundry and bathrooms accessible along the building’s shared wall.

The modern kitchen and island open into a shared dining and living space with vaulted ceilings, state of the art fixtures and a gateway to the outdoors. The deep, wide and similarly vaulted deck includes views of the creek and steps down to the manicured garden landscape.



Fontana’s stairwell opens into a custom entertainment room with console, TV and cable hookups. The space has natural light pouring through the windows and easy access to both additional bedrooms and the stairs.

Towards the street sits the second master with a full ensuite bathroom. The windows looks directly west making it the best room in the house for sunset-lovers.

At the other end of the top floor, the third bedroom overlooks the garden and East Bouldin Creek. Barn-style doors throughout add a rustic charm.

Noticing 3103 Fontana from the street, you will admire clean lines and a crisp color palette. Colors of the walls and trim are reversed on the covered parking areas which also feature electric car charging stations.

Manicured driveways and gated landscaping provide a serene stroll to the front door of either unit. High-end grasses and flora provide a low-maintenance visual appeal.



The back of the property falls away towards East Bouldin Creek. This elevation changes means when standing in the backyard, you’re looking up at the deck and living room of the units.

You can exit the backyard by taking the garden path that lends back to the front of the house along the fence line. While a small exterior stairwell provides access to the deck.",Townhouse,30.23252296447754,-97.76126861572266,2,False,2019,2,12196.8,3.6666666666666665,12,3.0,3

29333584,austin,"A sense of history, coupled with a love of design, defines the spirit of Keith House, a designated historical sight in Austin's venerated and coveted Pemberton Heights neighborhood. A long, wide covered front porch leads to a modern glass and metal front door and a bronze medallion forever marking this home as an important part of Austin's architectural history.  Designed originally in 1933 for the sister of noted architect, William D. Anderson, the home was built on this site to take advantage of the Capitol view. Although the view is long since blocked by growth and progress, its proximity to the urban energy of Austin's city center remains a particular asset in this prime location.
            
            Once inside the gates that surround the property, graceful landscaping shaded by huge, mature oaks provides a secluded stage for dinners or drinks under a covered pergola that seats 12, with brick walls on 3 sides and a fireplace at one end. This outdoor haven, wired for music, invites both grand and intimate gatherings under the canopy of trees.
            
            Immaculate, sunlit rooms inside are spacious, comfortable and inviting.  Rich, stained wood floors throughout the house anchor rooms with carefully crafted moldings, cased openings and bookcases harkening back in time and painted in tones of ivory and white to keep the atmosphere light and modern.  Two large living areas on the first floor provide space for entertaining or peaceful relaxation.  Window coverings of shades or plantation shutters have been professionally selected and perfectly complete each room.
            
            The kitchen has been expanded from the original design, with brilliant white glass-front cabinets and ivory, white and gray granite counters.  A gas, six-burner commercial style stove sits below a custom vent hood.  A farmhouse double pulley pendant marries old and new while lighting the work space of a large island flanked by a built-in refrigerator and a separate wine fridge.
            
            A small office retreat off the kitchen is as inviting as the larger rooms with glass doors leading to the outside.              
            
            In the entry, a winding staircase makes for a sweeping and lovely route upstairs toward two spacious bedrooms, both with doors that open to balconies.  The master bath is filled with light and features white marble counters, a claw foot tub, a separate glass shower and marble baseboards.  The second bedroom works as another master adjoining its own spacious bath with black and white basketweave tile floors and soft green trim.
            
            Taking ownership of this home fulfills a love of architecture and an attachment to our now bustling city.

29337911,austin,"On the shores of the city's treasured Lake Austin, Orleans Harbor reigns as one of the most desirable gated condominium locations. Over the years, the community has been evolving stylishly with major renovations creating one gorgeous residence after another. Individual statements of style and taste are reflected in these coveted homes hidden behind verdant courtyards. 2433 Westlake Drive is completely and lovingly remodeled with artistry, resulting in a dream environment of peace and privacy close to downtown. An easily accessible boat dock allows for a quick cruise around the lake or a lazy day on one the most beautiful bodies of water in Texas.
            
            The lovely elements and professionally selected surfaces inside evoke a French coastal experience and create a world of soft colors and exquisite craftsmanship that invite you to love being at home. An intimate, gated courtyard leads to a simple, refined, iron and glass front door that opens to the elegance of a burnished cathedral-vault entry. 
            
            Soft ivory walls throughout the home are presented in a venetian plaster finish accented by brick walls washed in perfectly coordinated muted tones that create a luxurious but organic feel. Travertine floors flow throughout the downstairs and wood floors above. Beamed ceilings, understated antique French chandeliers, and a wood burning fireplace crafts serene environs for life on the Lake. 
            
            Designed for quiet repose away from the world, this home is also a hub for entertaining and embraces friends and family to share the surroundings. Living and dining areas open through two sets of recently installed huge glass doors onto the large and private patio covered in herringbone antique brick and enveloped in thick, artful landscaping. 
            
            The kitchen lacks nothing and seems to have been plucked from a French design magazine. Light, glazed perimeter custom cabinetry with a contrasting island that houses a large, undermount porcelain sink. Designed to maximize storage and with details important to the serious (or just adventurous) cook, there are spice racks, lined knife drawers, trash pullouts, refrigerator drawers, in addition to the paneled refrigerator, wall oven, microwave and a Thermador induction 5-burner cooktop.
            
            Off the kitchen is the laundry room with storage, built in ironing board and a utility sink. Plenty of recently installed storage cabinets line the garage and the floor has been freshly coated with epoxy. 
            
            Up the wood stairway flanked by a scrolled iron handrail, the three bedrooms have their own views and individual style and were crafted with the same soft colors and high quality finishes as the main living areas. Barrel vaults in one, cross-member beams in another and the tray ceiling master make each a special retreat. The master bath is graced by double burnished cathedral ceilings, each adorned with a beautiful crystal chandelier. The result is a captivating escape for a sumptuous soak in the jetted tub or a long luxurious shower under beautiful tiles behind the glass door. 
            
            This unit is among three in the entire complex that have a water view from both the front and the back of the home.....you can enjoy the private balcony on the front which is accessed from two of the bedrooms or the upstairs balcony which has a view of the harbor and is accessed from the master and the third bedroom.

With its idyllic location in the Aldridge Place Historic District, this unique and rare Spanish Revival bungalow was designed and built in 1928 by distinguished architect Hugo Kuehne.  Kuehne, founder of the University of Texas School of Architecture, who was responsible for such noted works as the Austin History Center, the Commodore Perry Hotel, and the Ritz Theater.    The sellers purchased the home in 2011 and undertook a very extensive restoration and remodel throughout 2012/2013.  The project was designed by architect Ann Tucker of Studio A Group and built by Garland Turner of Woodeye Construction, with the goal of returning the home to its former glory. Unfortunately, there wasn't much left to work with when the owners took possession in 2011; doors and mantles had been removed, windows were oddly placed, and bathrooms had been cheaply redone. Despite these setbacks, the home has always remained a neighborhood favorite. The current owners took a lot of time and thought to make decisions to recreate a timeless home that will live on for the next 100 years.     The extensive, 10 month remodel included all new electrical, plumbing, roof, HVAC ductwork and returns, major foundation and leveling work, subfloors, fully-insulated walls/ceilings, level 5 wall finish, custom millwork, kitchen, baths, lighting, steel doors, windows, fireplace and chimney, flooring, and built-ins.
